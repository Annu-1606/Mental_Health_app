A machine learning project that predicts mental health conditions based on workplace and personal factors.
Trained on the OSMI Tech Survey 2016 dataset with ML/DL models, the system helps identify early signs of mental illness and suggests possible interventions.

âœ¨ Features

Preprocessing of 46K+ survey records (cleaning, feature selection, encoding)

User questionnaire mapped to numerical inputs for predictions

Machine learning models trained & evaluated:

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

NaÃ¯ve Bayes

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN with LSTM)

Dashboard to visualize results & monitor user well-being

Multilingual & audio input support (via NLP/translation APIs)

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, keras/tensorflow

Algorithms: SVM, Random Forest, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, RNN (LSTM)

Dataset: OSMI Tech Survey 2016

ðŸ“Š Dataset & Preprocessing

Rows: 46,234 | Columns: 64

Dropped irrelevant columns (name, age, dept, etc.)

Filled missing values using mode

Selected 15 key features (self-employment, family history, comfort at work, stress, career anxiety, etc.)

âœ… SVM achieved the best performance (93.11%) for predicting mental health disorders.

ðŸ§ª Application Workflow

User answers mental health questionnaire.

Responses are preprocessed and encoded.

Trained ML model predicts likelihood of mental health disorder.

Dashboard displays prediction & suggestions.
