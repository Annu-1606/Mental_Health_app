# ðŸ§  Psychological Well-Being Prediction (Machine Learning)

A **machine learning project** that predicts mental health conditions based on workplace and personal factors.  
Trained on the **OSMI Tech Survey 2016 dataset** with ML/DL models, the system helps identify early signs of mental illness and suggests possible interventions.
